A simple Instagram clone created to practice fundamental CSS and semantic HTML.

Initially followed provided Figma guide but decided to update the UI to something a little more modern.

Kept to basic goals for this project because I wanted to move on but plan to expand to stretch goals and javascript interactivity at a later date.
